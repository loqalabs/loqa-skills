## Description

Add built-in 'Set a timer' skill with local tracking and TTS countdown/complete response. Support community durations ('set a 15-minute meeting timer'), announce when timer expires via TTS playback, store and cancel timers locally on the hub. Essential basic functionality for community adoption.

## Implementation Notes

GitHub Issue: https://github.com/loqalabs/loqa-skills/issues/9. Moved from main loqa repository task-6 for proper service ownership.
